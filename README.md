## WorthIt
---

### Overview 
This is a Python (2.7) program that uses the Google Maps API to locate nearby gas stations 
and fetches their prices per gallon to tell the user what 
location is most economical (taking into account both price and distance from user).  

### The Files
It is split into five files: main.py, distance.py, places.py, prices.py, and priceComp.py
The last four do what their names imply and the main.py compiles all of them into one program. 

<b>Note:</b> if you're implementing this with python 3.X, you'll have to make some syntax changes 
(mainly changing print statements to include parentheses)
